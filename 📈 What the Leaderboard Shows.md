ðŸ“ˆ What the Leaderboard Shows
This leaderboard highlights the most significant proofs recorded by the Field of Truth system. Each entry represents a validated Collatz path for a specific number n, verified through agentic processes, and logged with full metadata.

Each leaderboard entry includes:

n: The starting number tested.

Steps: Number of iterations to reach 1 (the path length).

Max Value: The highest value reached in the sequence.

Time: How long the verification took.

Depth: Equivalent to convergence depth Îž(n).

Signature: A unique digital hash proving path integrity.

These results are ranked by the largest n and greatest depth.
They prove that the system handles not just symbolic argumentsâ€”but massive, real computations.
Each number here is a brick in the wall of proof.
